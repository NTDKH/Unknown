00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:28,880
I have a flight to catch later.

178
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:58,040
I'm home.

179
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,370
Qian, you're back.

180
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:06,040
Thank you, Qian.

181
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:07,880
"Thank you, Qian."

182
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,880
All you care about is presents.

183
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:13,540
You bought the wrong one again.

184
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:15,630
Didn't I tell you in the group chat?

185
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:17,420
How could I make a mistake?
There's no such thing.

186
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:18,000
It's wrong.

187
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Isn't this the one?

188
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,130
No.

189
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:21,750
Really?

190
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,290
I'm sorry.

191
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,290
I'll buy the right one next time.

192
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:26,920
The others are for Zhiyuan.

193
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:27,920
Pass them to him.

194
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,920
There are so many for Zhiyuan.

195
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,170
Right, where's Zhiyuan?

196
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:30,790
I have no idea.

197
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:32,630
I think he just went out.

198
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:33,630
He went out?

199
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:36,790
Qian, listen here.

200
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:38,130
I think Wei Zhiyuan

201
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:39,790
has been acting really strange lately.

202
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:41,920
Strange? How?

203
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,420
He's been

204
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:46,540
like,

205
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,880
seemingly...

206
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:50,290
Spit it out.

207
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:51,670
He's like...

208
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:53,670
It's just that he...

209
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:56,130
He seems to be in love.

210
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:58,380
In love?

211
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,750
It's good to be in love.

212
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,250
You should be happy for him.

213
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:07,000
No, but he watches those...

214
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,750
I can't explain it.

215
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:12,000
I don't know what it is.

216
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,130
He... He has grown up now.

217
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:16,630
It's normal for him
to watch such things.

218
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:17,500
No.

219
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:18,750
No.

220
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:21,040
But those things aren't...

221
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,920
- Wait.
- I really don't know...

222
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,380
Did you see what he was watching?

223
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,920
You're still young, don't watch it.

224
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,630
Got it?

225
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:29,880
It's not that kind of thing.

226
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,790
Stop eating.

227
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,250
You can eat later.

228
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:32,920
I haven't eaten yet.

229
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,130

I'll show you up there.

231
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,420
He's been watching romantic films

232
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,250
and he bought romance novels.

233
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,670
What do you mean?

234
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:40,500
It's really strange.

235
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,000
I can't explain it.

236
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,630
Just go and see yourself.

237
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:48,130
Look, That Summer's Sweet.

238
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:49,630
How can summer be sweet?

239
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:51,920
And this. What is this?

240
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,540
I saw this the other day.

241
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:56,130
Black Rushing Water in the Blue Lake.

242
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:57,790
This looks terrible.

243
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,250
He even cried when watching them.

244
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,500
He cried?

245
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,250
It's really strange.

246
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,540
There's nothing to cry about.

247
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:08,380

Yes, I'm free.

We should come out
and exercise more often.

Aren't I doing it now?

Let me ask you something.

280
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,540
Are you still in touch
with your class monitor

281
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,540
in high school?

282
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,880
High school?

283
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:48,380
Yes.

284
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:49,540
Weren't you always in touch

285
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,040
with a classmate in high school?

286
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,380
The class monitor of yours.

287
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:54,170
You only talked to him.

288
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,540
At that time, it was just
because I wanted to find someone

289
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,000
to communicate with.

290
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:04,130
Why him?

291
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:07,170
Because he has
the same birthday as you.

292

Is that so?

293
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:13,880
Then I'll find someone

294
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,790
whose birthday is the same
as Lili's next time.

00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,290
Let's go fishing.

349
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:16,040
Okay.

350
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,670
Isn't this the company car?

351
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:31,670
Yes, I borrowed it.

352
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:33,920
Let's go. Get in the car.

353
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:36,170
Let me drive.

354
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:39,250
You?

355
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:40,500
I'm an adult now.

356
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,130
Can you drive?

357
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:45,380
I've got my license.

358
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,790
What's wrong?

359
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:21,670
Seat belt.

360
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:26,000
What's wrong?

361
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,630
Nothing. I'm drowsy.

362
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:31,380
Drive carefully.

363
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:33,670
Call me if you need anything.

364
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:36,630
Don't worry.

365
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,630
I'll be very careful

366
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:40,630
with you in my car.

367
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,040
Why didn't you wake me up to help you?

368
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:39,420
I saw you were still sleeping,

369
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:40,540
so I didn't want to disturb you.

370
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:43,250
Did you get enough sleep?

371
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:52,790
Come on, let me do it.

372
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:00,750
Listen,

373
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:01,920
do it like this.

374
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:03,380
Come on.

375
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:13,380
There's a kind of peace and tranquillity

376
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:15,380
when you're by my side.

377
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,630
Jiang Ziya didn't expect
the fish to take the bait.

378
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:25,000
The same goes
for Wei Qian and Wei Zhiyuan.

379
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,130
It feels so good.

380
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:45,250
It's good to be around you.

381
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:47,880
Of course.

382
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:50,790
Will you feel bad to be around me?

383
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:57,630
But you can't

384
00:23:57,630 --> 00:23:59,130
be around me forever.

385
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,880
Why?

386
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:04,130
You'll meet someone you like later.

387
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:09,880
How's it?

388
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:12,920
Have you been seeing someone lately?

389
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:14,880
What about you?

390
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:17,380
Are you seeing anyone?

391
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,130
I don't have time for that.

392
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,000
You've never even liked anyone?

393
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:30,000
I think I have.

394
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,380
Who's it?

395
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:34,380
Does a film star count?

396
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:43,880
No patience. You've only
been fishing for a little while.

397
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:46,000
I'm the most patient one.

398
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,420
What do you want?

399
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:30,430
[The fourth type of family member
is someone who is always there for you]

400
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:55,500
When did we have

401
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,790
a future sister-in-law in our family?

402
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:58,670
I really think they're a good match.

403
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,630
I like that guy,
and it's my own business.

404
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:03,630
It has nothing to do with you.

405
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:06,630
Yuan.

406
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:08,000
He gives off

407
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:09,880
a very strange vibe.

408
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,920
It's so different.

409
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,000
Is it possible

410
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,500
that you are the one Yuan likes?
