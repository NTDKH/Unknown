Yes, she's beautiful and rich

174
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:08,540
and she can...

175
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:10,330
No, the main thing is she can handle

176
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:12,170
a workaholic like Qian.

177
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:13,960
And both are very good at their jobs.

178
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,790
Yes, one workaholic deserves another.

179
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:17,580
Right.

180
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:18,540
The perfect match.

181
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:27,420
What's up? You...

182
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,290
You look serious.

183
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:33,290
Is it because of the funds?

184
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:34,210
Or...

185
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:37,790
I hope we can keep

186
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:39,420
business and personal matters separate.

187
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,710
I appreciate your feelings towards me,

188
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,290
but I'm sorry.

189
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,210
I don't think I can give you

190
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:49,170
what you want.

191
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:53,290
May I know why?

192
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:57,170
I just want to know.

193
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:01,460
The most important people in my life

194
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,290
are my younger brother and sister.

195
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:07,420
I don't have time for anyone else.

196
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:09,960
But one day, they will grow up,

197
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,330
get married, and have children.

198
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:13,670
They will leave you.

199
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:16,290
I don't mind.

200
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:19,830
Sometimes,

201
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,920
two isn't better than one.

202
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:23,670
Right?

203
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:34,040
If telling you this

204
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,540
will affect your decision today,

205
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:36,830
then...

206
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:38,040
Actually...

207
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,330
It will.

208
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:51,920
Sorry.

209
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,170
You took it for real?

210
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:55,540
I was just kidding.
Don't take it so seriously.

211
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:58,170
I told you.

212
00:14:58,170 --> 00:14:59,210
Business is business.

213
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:01,290
I'm not someone
who lets personal emotions

214
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:02,420
ruin important matters.

215
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:03,830
I won't threaten you or anything

216
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:07,290
for such reasons.

217
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:08,830
No, I...

218
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:10,830
I was already thinking

219
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:12,920
about how I'm going to explain
to the others outside...

220
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,080
Sorry.

221
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,790
But can you promise me one thing?

222
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,210
All right. Name it.

223
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:24,960
Stay honest, always.

224
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,080
That's one

225
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,540
of the important qualities

226
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,420
I've noticed about you since I knew you.

227
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:32,330
And I really appreciate that.

228
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:35,920
OK.

229
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:38,790
I can promise you that. I can do it.

230
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:41,460
Pleasure working with you.

231
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:42,420
All right.

232
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,540
Pleasure working with you.

233
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:47,080
Thank you again for trusting me

234
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,170
and supporting me from the beginning.

235
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:51,290
Really. I keep it in my heart.

236
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:52,460
Thank you.

237
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:55,580
This is our company's signature swing.

238
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,790
I designed this

239
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:58,290
because I think our daily work

240
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,960
at the company is too boring,

241
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,920
so during lunch and afternoon tea,

242
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,330
we all come over here...

243
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:04,830
Take a break.

244
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,290
Good work.

245
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:07,290
I...

246
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:09,210
Come here.

247
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:10,670
Where's Yuan?

248
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:12,420
Did you see him?

249
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:14,210
Yuan? He was over there earlier.

250
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:16,290
Where did he go?

251
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:21,080
Where's Feng Ning?

252
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,420
Why did you want
to talk to Feng Ning?

253
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,460
To tell her I can't return her feelings.

254
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:26,460
Something's off about Yuan...

255
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,920
Hang on. What did you say?

256
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:30,790
I told her I don't feel the same way.

257
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,080
Have you lost your mind?

258
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,830
Why did you do that?

259
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:37,420
Well, you just had to play matchmaker.

260
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:38,540
I couldn't do that to her, so...

261
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,170
So? What did she say?

262
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:41,580
She said it was fine.
She was OK with it.

263
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:42,330
What? Fine? OK?

264
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:43,920
What did she say?

265
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,040
Something wasn't right about Yuan.

266
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,710
I need to go to him.

267
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:47,920
No, I...

268
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:51,080
Oh, dear...

269
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:55,540
Xiong.

270
00:16:58,170 --> 00:16:59,040
Xiong.

271
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:21,330
What are you doing here?

272
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:27,790
Sit up straight.

273
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:30,080
You're burning up.

274
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,710
I'll bring you inside.

275
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,670
Come on.

276
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:34,920
Let's go.

277
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:39,540
Why did you drink so much?

278
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:42,670
Be careful.

279
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:45,330
All right?

280
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:47,290
Let's go.

281
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:48,920
Qian...

282
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:50,960
What?

283
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:53,290
I like you.

284
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:55,920
Wei Zhiyuan, you're drunk.

285
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,040
Stand up straight.

286
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,170
Stand properly.

287
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,040
Stand properly!

288
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:03,420
Qian...

289
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:06,790
I like you.

290
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:11,670
All right, all right. I like you too.

291
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:12,960
I like you too.

292
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,170
Everyone likes you. Come on.

293
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:16,790
Do you think I'm joking?

294
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,960
Do you seriously think I'm joking?

295
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:24,920
What are you talking about?

296
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:27,420
I said

297
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:29,210
I like you.

298
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:32,080
The person I like is Wei Qian.

299
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:34,330
I like my brother!

300
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:39,170
What's wrong with you?

301
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:40,420
Why can't I like you?

302
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:42,790
Why?

303
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,040
Wei Zhiyuan...

♪I don't like to say sweet nothings

308
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,790
You think I wanted this?

309
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:03,540
It hurts me!

310
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:05,170
I'm suffering...

00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:07,590

00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:12,210
Qian...

314
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:15,290
Get lost.

315
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:16,580
Qian, look at me...

316
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:18,670
Get lost.

317
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:19,540
Qian, look at me...

318
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:20,790
Leave!

319
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:26,040
I told you to leave!

320
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,210
What's that noise?

321
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:36,460
What are you two doing?

322
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:37,460
Yuan!

323
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,210
Are you all right?

324
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:44,960
Let me look at it.

325
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,960
You guys are brothers.

326
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,540
What's the meaning of this, huh?

327
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:54,420
Would brothers do this?

328
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:55,920
Would brothers come to this?

329
00:19:57,290 --> 00:19:59,290
Did I owe him in my past life?

330
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:01,170
Yuan.

331
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,420
Let him cool his head.

332
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:06,580
He's bleeding! Didn't you see that?

333
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,420
Pass the tomatoes.

334
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:53,170
Morning, Qian.

335
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:54,170
Breakfast.

336
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:55,290
You enjoy your breakfast.

337
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,830
San Pang told me everything.

338
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:05,580
You just had to go and pick a fight,

339
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:07,170
during a company event no less.

340
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:07,920
Serves you right.

341
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,790
No wonder Qian was so angry.

342
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,710
Qian.

343
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:22,420
Qian.

344
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:24,960
Qian, hear me out.

345
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,040
I'm sorry...

346
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:30,290
