24
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:17,210
You like boys?

25
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:19,080
Have you thought it through?

26

to have someone in your heart?

38
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:52,080
It's one thing to keep it for a day,

39
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,420

But why does it have to be a guy?

49
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:24,330
There are so many girls in the world.

I know people are more accepting now,

57
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,460
but it doesn't mean every family

58
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:54,670

It's OK.

175
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:04,830
It's late. Shouldn't you be sleeping?

176
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:06,040
Why did you come down?

177
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,420
It's nothing.

178
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,040
Get me some water.

179
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:27,420
Stop taking headache pills.

180
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,040
Come on.

181
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:38,920
Better?

182
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:43,330
How's this?

183
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:01,540
Wei Qian.

184
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:07,790
He left his phone here.

185
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:09,290
No wonder he wasn't answering.

186
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:12,040
He slept in again.

187
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,420
Wei Qian!

188
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,040
Wei Qian.

189
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,920
Wei Qian...

190
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:28,790
Sorry.

191
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,040
What? I drank too much last night

192
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,170
and overslept.

193
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:16,670
Fine. I know it's gruelling to drive.

194
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,420
I'll drive the whole of next week, OK?

195
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,170
Come on. Let's go.

196
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:28,040
Let's go. Hurry up.

197
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:47,920
It's not what it looks like.

198
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,460
I didn't say anything.

199
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,170
Yuan...

200
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:11,790
likes boys.

201
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,040
He likes boys?

202
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:21,670
So, how can I push him away

203
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:22,580
or judge him

204
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:23,960
like other people?

205
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:26,960
So you held him to sleep?

206
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:29,920
He held me.

207
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,290
Not the other way around.

208
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,170
But you seemed to be enjoying it.

209
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:36,170
Stop your nonsense.

210
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:37,460
I just didn't push him away.

211
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:39,040
I don't want him

212
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,420
to feel like an outcast.

213
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:42,290
Wait.

214
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:49,540
Are you the boy Yuan likes?

215
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:52,040
What the heck are you saying?

216
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:53,670
Not a chance!

217
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:55,540
I'm serious.

218
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:56,670
Think about it.

219
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:58,460
The way he looked at you before

220
00:14:58,670 --> 00:14:59,540
and the way he took care of you

221
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:00,920
in the hospital,

222
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,580
that's something only someone
who likes you would do.

223
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:03,710
Do you understand?

224
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,330
Don't talk nonsense.

225
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,420
Let's go.

226
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:32,290
Who is it?

227
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:34,040
It's San Pang.

228
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:38,290
Give me a second!

229
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:39,420
Be right there!

230
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,420
Hurry up.

231
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:44,670
Lili.

232
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:46,040
Coming!

233
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:52,540
San Pang, what brings you here?

234
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:54,920
Oh, nothing important.

235
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:56,920
I just wanna talk to Wei Zhiyuan.

236
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:59,290
Sorry. I was cleaning up.

237
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:00,670
- Let me get you a drink.
- Cleaning up?

238
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,170
Lili.

239
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:03,790
Thanks, San Pang.

240
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:04,670
Got you dumplings.
Put them in the freezer.

241
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:05,540
OK.

242
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,830
That Wei Zhiyuan,

243
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,170
always making such a mess.

244
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:12,790
Sorry.

245
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:14,540
I was cleaning up.

246
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,540
What would this family do without me?

247
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:17,670
Drink this.

248
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:18,540
Yuan isn't home?

249
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:19,420
Nope.

250
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:20,920
He should be back soon.

251
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:27,790
I'll let you clean up. I'll head back.

252
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:28,790
- I can come again later.
- It's OK.

253
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:30,290
You're waiting
for Qian and Zhiyuan, right?

254
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:32,040
You can take a seat.

255
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,790
I'll tidy up.

256
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:35,790
Wei Zhiyuan never cleans up
after himself.

257
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:37,920
What a mess. Seriously.

258
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,790
He always leaves his food over
just like this.

259
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:43,040
San Pang, don't sit there.

260
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,170
It's for feet.

261
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,170
Sit here.

262
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,170
OK.

263
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:48,920
Take a seat.

264
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,920
Lili, pause.

265
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,290
Take a seat.

266
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:02,290
I came for you.

267
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,040
I have something to ask you.

268
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:06,920
Me?

269
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,040
Sit down.

270
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:12,540
Lili,

271
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:14,290
I need you to tell me.

272
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:19,540
Where do you usually sleep?

273
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:24,290
In my room.

274
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:27,290
In your room, in your bed, right?

275
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:28,290
Mhm.

276
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:30,790
Where do I usually sleep?

277
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:34,790
How would I know?

278
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:36,920
You can sleep wherever you want.

279
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:39,540
We're all adults.

280
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:41,920
We have our own beds, right?

281
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:45,460
So, why are Qian and Zhiyuan

282
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,790
still sleeping in the same bed?

283
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:53,420
Zhiyuan always gets

284
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:54,920
into Qian's bed.

285
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:55,540
I used to do that

286
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:57,040
when I was a kid too.

287
00:17:59,040 --> 00:17:59,830
You shouldn't do that.

288
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:03,040
Do you still do that?

289
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,790
Not anymore.

290
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:06,540
That's right. Listen to me.

291
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:08,170
Girls shouldn't simply sleep with boys.

292
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:08,830
Got it?

293
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:15,540
San Pang.

294
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,670
You care about that?

295
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:20,420
Of course.

296
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:22,670
Yuan isn't biologically related
to you two.

297
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:24,170
What if he...

298
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:25,290
What if he does something to me?

299
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:26,540
That's impossible.

300
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:28,790
He only has eyes on Qian.

301
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,670
Right. That's what I'm talking about.

302
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:39,420
That's my point.

303
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,920
I think

304
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,460
Yuan has feelings

305
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:47,170
for Qian.

306
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:49,170
Strange, peculiar

307
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,540
feelings.

308
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:51,920
It's something different.

309
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:52,790
Different?

310
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:54,790
Really?

311
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,790
You're reading too much into it.

312
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,290
Qian said

313
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:02,920
he'd only have me and Yuan
for the rest of his life

314
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,040
until the two of us
found the right ones.

315
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,330
I often wonder

316
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:11,580
if in the end,

317
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,920
Qian will be the one of the three of us

318
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,670
who can't let go of this family.

319
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:21,170
San Pang.

320
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:24,670
Do you have someone you like?

321
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:27,290
Yes.

322
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:31,670
Who?

323
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:33,420
I won't tell you.

324
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:41,290
Can you understand this?

325
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:42,540
Yes, I can.

326
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:44,830
That's what love is.

327
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:54,290
Mr. Wei,

328
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:56,830
the schedule for the project

329
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:58,790
we discussed last time is out.

330
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:08,670
The growth of our fan base now...

331
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:09,920
Thanks.

332
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,290
I have a question.

333
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:12,290
Do you have an older sister?

334
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,920
I have a younger sister. Why?

335
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,420
OK, great.

336
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:18,170
Do you two sleep together?

337
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:20,170
What?

338
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:22,670
I asked, do you two sleep together?

339
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:24,420
What an odd question. You're weird.

340
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:25,290
What's it to you?

341
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:27,040
Come on, Eric.

342
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,540
We helped you make

343
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:29,670
a lot of money.

344
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:31,420
You can't just pull out the funds.

345
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:33,420
Doing business is
all about keeping one's word.

346
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:34,540
Being trustworthy.

347
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:39,040
Fine. Are you going
to take legal action against us?

348
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,290
Are you sure
you wanna take legal action?

349
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:41,920
Yes, that's right.

350
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,790
So, if they withdraw the funds,

351
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:46,040
we...

352
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,420
Yes, we're really troubled.

353
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:48,670
So, I called you,

354
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:50,790
Mr. Jiang, to discuss if we could

355
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:53,290
find some compromise?

356
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:55,420
Is it possible for you

357
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,290
to extend the payment deadline?

358
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:58,420
Give us an extra month.

359
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:00,920
Jiang, long time no see.

360
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,540
How have you been lately?

361
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:04,540
OK.

362
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:06,290
Yes, I saw the photos you posted.

363
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:08,790
Your daughter is absolutely adorable.

364
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:12,170
No, I've been tied up with work...

365
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:18,540
Yuan.

366
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:19,670
San Pang.

367
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:20,540
Hi, everyone.

368
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,040
What's all this?

369
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,670
I'm going to training camp.

370
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:25,170
Have you eaten?

371
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:25,670
I have.

372
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:26,170
You have?

373
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:27,290
Where's my brother?

374
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:28,040
Over there.

375
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,290
Still taking care of some things.
Hasn't even eaten yet.

376
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:34,710
Hello?

377
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,040
Qian.

378
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:44,170
Why are you here?

379
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,670
Weren't you supposed
to go to training camp?

380
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,040
San Pang said you skipped meals again.

381
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,540
Why do you always do that?

382
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:53,710
Can't you see I'm busy?

383
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:07,670
- Still, you need to eat.
- This is Wei Qian.

384
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:09,330
I need your help with something.

385
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:10,290
Get back to me

386
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:11,790
when you see this message, please.

387
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:29,170
Cao?

388
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:30,790
Reply when you see my message.

389
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:32,290
It's urgent.

390
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:39,420
What is it?

391
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:43,580
I just took it.

392
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:45,040
That was lutein.

393
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,330
This is vitamin B.

394
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:50,420
Can't you give them all to me in one go?

395
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:01,210
His little brother is making him
take his pills.

396
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:03,290
Hello? Duoli...

397
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,330
Qian.

398
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:07,830
Can you take a break?

399
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:09,920
I have a lot I need to do today.

400
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,170
I can't afford to rest.

401
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:14,290
Would five minutes
really make a difference?

402
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:16,420
Your company won't matter

403
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:18,960
if you don't take care of yourself.

404
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:21,170
Take a nap, please?

405
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:21,920
Maybe the ideas will come

406
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,670
once you're refreshed.

407
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:28,290
Come on.

408
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:35,170
Here.

409
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:38,540
Come on.

410
00:23:58,670 --> 00:23:59,790
Qian.

411
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:04,670
Maybe I should skip the training camp

412
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:07,420
and stay here to take care of you.

413
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:09,040
I don't need you to do that.

414
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,040
Do what you should.

415
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:13,540
As if I need you to take care of me.

416
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:16,040
Get going.

417
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:23,920
Oh, right.

418
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:26,170
I got all your supplements here.

419
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:28,170
One compartment a day.

420
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:28,670
Got it.

421
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:29,790
Remember to take them.

422
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,540
I'll put it here.

423
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:35,540
OK.

424
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:38,670
I'm off, then.

425
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:40,670
Quick!

426
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:41,670
Wait.

427
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:43,330
Do you have enough money with you?

428
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:45,080
I do.

429
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,170
- OK.
- Take care of yourself.

430
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,290
Yuan, are you leaving?

431
00:24:57,170 --> 00:24:58,040
Want some?

432
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,420
I'm fine, thanks.
I'll leave you guys to it.

433
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:01,290
Amy, here.

434
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:03,420
Please make sure

435
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:04,920
to give my brother
his effervescent tablets.

436
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,540
OK.

437
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,920
If he has a headache,

438
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:09,170
a strong brew of green tea
and brown sugar

439
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:09,920
should do the trick.

440
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,830
OK, no problem.

441
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:12,540
San Pang,

442
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:14,540
I've put the gastric pills
that work for Qian

443
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:16,040
in his drawer.

444
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:19,290
Make sure he takes them.

445
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:20,170
Got it.

446
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:21,540
Please take care of my brother

447
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:23,290
while I'm away.

448
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:24,040
Thank you.

449
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,670
We will, don't worry.

450
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:27,920
Where are you going?

451
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,790
I'll drive you.

452
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:30,420
It's OK, I can take a taxi.

453
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:31,290
Are you sure?

454
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:32,290
Bye, Yuan.

455
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:33,040
Bye.

456
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,290
- Safe trip.
- Tell us when you get there.

457
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:35,170
OK.

458
00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:38,540
San Pang.

459
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:41,670
Does Qian always listen
to his little brother?

460
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:43,920
Don't you think
they're not really like brothers?

461
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,290
Don't you think Yuan's a little...

462
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,040
That relationship.

463
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,920
Forbidden love between brothers, right?

464
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:49,790
Yes!

465
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:50,790
Do you realise?

466
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:53,040
Yuan's the only one
who can get Qian to do something.

467
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:53,790
- Yes!
- Yes!

468
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:55,170
Right?

469
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:57,540
You guys have nothing better to do, huh?

470
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:00,290
You've been eating for so long.

471
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:01,670
Isn't lunch break almost over?

472
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:03,040
Speed it up, you guys.

473
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,670
We've got a lot of work to do, OK?

474
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:05,920
Get to work.

475
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:08,170
San Pang.

476
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:10,670
Come with me to the bank.

477
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:11,170
The bank?

478
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:12,290
Yes, the bank.

479
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:13,790
Hurry up. Thanks.

480
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:28,210
Fei.

481
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:39,670
Qian.

482
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:41,420
Dinner.

483
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:43,670
I didn't order anything.

484
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:44,790
Well, we ordered for you.

485
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:48,790
Qian, your effervescent tablet.

486
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:49,790
Drink up.

487
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:54,540
Qian, remember to take this.

488
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,670
- What's your problem?
- What's wrong?

489
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:07,420
Did Yuan ask you guys to do that?

490
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,170
Having you guys
give me stuff one by one.

491
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:13,040
I almost thought it was my birthday.

492
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,290
Why are you upset?

493
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:16,920
Yuan came all this way,

494
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:19,170
bowed 90 degrees,

495
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:20,790
and asked us to help.

496
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:22,290
How could we not?

497
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,210
Have you noticed

498
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,670
that Yuan takes care of you

499
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:38,040
like you're his treasure?

500
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:41,170
What are you talking about?

501
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:46,290
So, how are you going to deal with it?

502
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,040
Deal with what?

503
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,540
The thing with Yuan.

504
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:54,040
Let me tell you,

505
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,420
who or what he likes doesn't matter.

506
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:58,670
What matters is that you're his brother.

507
00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:00,290
Do you really know him?

508
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,920
Are you still going on about that

509
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,540
at a time like this?

510
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:07,290
So I can't talk about this again?

511
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:08,920
He's my little brother too.

512
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,170
- I care about him too.
- Go back to your desk.

513
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:12,670
Great news!

514
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:14,830
Fabulous news.

515
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:16,170
Everyone,

516
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:19,330
Beauty Life is willing

517
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:21,040
to make up for the rest of the funds!

518
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:24,540
I knew it.

519
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:25,920
Wei Qian, you're good.

520
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,210
You've got men and women
falling for you.

521
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,790
Feng Ning sacrificed so much for love.

522
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:30,790
Really?

523
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:33,290
Hold on.

524
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,580
Why would she suddenly invest?

525
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:37,670
Qian,

526
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:39,670
could it be because our product is good?

527
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:42,040
Could it be because our plan is good?

528
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:42,460
Right?

529
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:44,040
Can you think about the company?

530
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,170
Can you think for the company?

531
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:47,080
Can you?

532
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:51,540
I'll pass you the contact info.

533
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:52,290
Hurry up and get in touch.

534
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:52,670
OK.

535
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:54,670
We've made up the shortfall, everyone.

536
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:56,290
Let's keep working hard!

537
00:28:56,290 --> 00:28:57,790
Keep going!

538
00:28:58,290 --> 00:28:59,540
The future is for those

539
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:02,040
who don't limit themselves.

540
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,920
Let's strive for a possibility

541
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,540
in the future together.

542
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,040
I think

543
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:29,040
you don't need to look elsewhere

544
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,710
for the remaining funds.

545
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:34,790
Really? That's great.

546
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:37,670
So maybe for the legal part...

547
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:38,420
Not a problem.

548
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:40,170
Jane will discuss the details with you.

549
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:43,290
Excuse me, Ms. Feng.

550
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:47,330
Mind if I ask you a question?

551
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:52,790
Why would you want to invest in us

552
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:55,170
when our company is in such bad shape?

553
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:56,080
Of course, it's because

554
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,580
your presentation was excellent,

555
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:59,790
and our product is fantastic.

556
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:01,290
Do you think I'm stupid?

557
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:04,670
You think I'm investing

558
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:05,920
because I used to be your fan?

559
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,790
Is...

560
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:08,290
Is that so?

561
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:14,920
You're talented

562
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:16,670
and charming.

563
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:20,170
But I'm more interested

564
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,420
in your team's work.

565
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:25,170
I'm sorry.

566
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:27,830
I was in a hurry today

567
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:28,960
so I didn't prepare anything much.

568
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,540
I hope you'll like this.

569
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:31,790
You're too kind. Thank you.

570
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:33,170
Jane, please follow up

571
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:34,920
with Mr. Xiong.

572
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:35,920
Thank you.

573
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:42,790
This is a special gift for you.

574
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:44,170
Thank you.

575
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,670
I'll take that for you.

576
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:46,460
San Pang.

577
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:48,670
OK. Thank you.

578
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:49,540
OK.

579
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:56,170
Happy working together.

580
00:30:56,170 --> 00:30:57,170
The pleasure is mine.

581
00:30:57,170 --> 00:30:58,420
Cake.

582
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,420
Lili.

583
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:10,420
San Pang's here too.

584
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:12,290
Yes. Want some cake?

585
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:13,290
You're home.

586
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:15,170
Sit. Have some cake.

587
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:16,790
Why do we have cake?

588
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:19,290
It's from your future sister-in-law.

589
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:20,420
It's delicious.

590
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,540
Would you like some coffee?

591
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:23,670
Future sister-in-law?

592
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:25,170
When did we get

593
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:26,670
a future sister-in-law?

594
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:28,790
You didn't see her the other day.

595
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:29,920
Here, I'll show you.

596
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:33,040
This is her.

597
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:36,920
I think they're a good match.

598
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:40,420
How?

599
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:41,790
They're just fine.

600
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:42,790
What's that?

601
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:45,580
She asked me to give it to your brother.

602
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:46,290
Don't peek.

603
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:47,790
It won't hurt.

604
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,170
It looks expensive.

605
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:50,290
It's a pen.

606
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:51,710
It even has Qian's name on it.

607
00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:53,170
My goodness.

608
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:54,460
My future sister-in-law
is really something.

609
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:57,790
But she still needs to go through me.

610
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:59,210
Sit down and have some cake.
Where are you going?

611
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:00,170
Yuan.

612
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:29,290
