00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:09,540
When will you learn to be independent?

177
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,040
I have Qian at home

178
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,290
and you at school.

179
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:13,910
I'll leave the school soon.

180
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,290
I'm skipping a grade
and going to high school next semester.

181
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:19,910
What? Traitor!

182
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:21,660
You're leaving me behind!

183
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,080
I'm not abandoning you.

184
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,910
It's embarrassing to be
in the same class with you.

185
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:27,540
I don't care!

186
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,580
Who is going to have my back
from now on at school?

187
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:30,580
You're on your own.

188
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:31,950
Not bad.

189
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,790
Why didn't you bring this up at dinner?

190
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:42,580
What is this shocking news
you're talking about?

191
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,660
A child raised in rainbow and sunshine
has the luxury

192
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:49,160
of not wanting to grow up.

193
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,500
But for us, who were abandoned

194
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,660
and left to our own fate,

195
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:57,000
we are forced to grow up.

196
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,750
We find our own ways

197
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:01,330
to survive.

198
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,410
What's your name?

199
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:15,080
Hello, sir. I am Wei Qian.

200
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:18,160
I was told I'd never starve
as long as I followed you.

201
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:20,040
I can do anything,

202
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:22,580
but I'm only working part-time.

203
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,790
I still have to go to school.

204
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:27,410
Kid.

205
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:29,660
Can you clean the toilet?

206
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:33,580
Gui, I got you a helper.

207
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,330
Hu, thank you.

208
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:37,910
I've been looking for a worker
for quite some time.

209
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:39,450
Thanks.

210
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,040
Sir, your betel nuts.

211
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:48,200
Thanks.

212
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:18,790
Go away!

213
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:20,160
Who are you?

214
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:21,910
Go away! Back off!

215
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:22,910
Who are you?

216
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,790
What? Do you want a fight?

217
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,790
Put that thing down!

218
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:32,290
You're a nuisance!

219
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:33,410
I hate you!

220
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:34,830
Go away.

221
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:36,700
Go away.

You have great potential.

246
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:23,450
Qian,

247
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:25,450
can I let him in?

248
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:27,540
Get your dinner.

249
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:30,200
You can come inside.

250
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:36,660
So,

251
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:39,450
we are all looking for that ray of light

252
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:41,910
in this desolate darkness.

253
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,700
What's the name of the kid you kept?

254
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:51,660
He is Yuan.

255
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:53,160
Does he go to school?

256
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,330
Is he even registered?

257
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,290
He can't go to school
unless he is registered.

258
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,540
Do you doubt me?

259
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:17,790
You got the money.

260
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,040
You know what to do.

261
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:26,660
You heard him.

262
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:36,910
What do you want?

263
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,290
The new batter is pretty good.

264
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:45,290
He is nasty.

265
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:46,410
Well?

266
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:47,660
The boss is giving a test.

267
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:48,660
Leave it to the kid.

268
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:49,790
Drink your tea.

269
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,660
I told him long ago.

270
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,080
This sounds like music to me.

271
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,660
"Stop hitting me."

272
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:00,330
Come out.

273
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:02,040
Boss.

274
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,080
He has the guts.

275
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:07,080
He has fallen asleep.

276
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:21,660
I can give you even more.

277
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:31,450
Wei Xiaoyuan?

278
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,290
That's a bad name.

279
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:39,450
"Wei no Yuan."

280
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:45,700
We put something in the middle.

281
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:47,660
Wei Zhiyuan.

282
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,410
That means the kid

283
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:51,910
is yours.

284
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,290
Well? Do you like that?

285
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:04,770
[146 CM, Yuan, 2011]

286
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,200
Dr. Lin.

287
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,040
Where is Wei Qian?

288
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:16,330
You want me to go home?

289
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:17,160
He'll live.

290
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,950
How can I go home
when you're all beaten up?

291
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:19,660
It has nothing

292
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:20,790
to do with you. Just go home.

293
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,040
Look at the time now.

294
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:23,160
You're injured.

295
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,450
I can't just leave you here.

296
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:27,540
Mind your own business.
Have you finished your homework?

297
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,580
San Pang can take care of me.

298
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:30,540
Go home.

299
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:32,660
No. I want to be with you.

300
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,660
- Do as he says.
- Go home.

301
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,160
Not while you're injured!

302
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,160
I can't...

303
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,700
I'm fine. Don't worry.

304
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,450
Yuan, Lili is all alone at home.

305
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:42,290
Okay?

306
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:43,160
It's not like I'm not going home.

307
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:43,790
I will later.

308
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:45,040
Yeah, he has a point.

309
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:45,910
Be a good boy.

310
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:46,910
Come on.

311
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:48,660
I'm fine.

312
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:49,660
Are you sure?

313
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:50,660
I'm sure.

314
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:51,910
Don't worry about him.

315
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:53,330
Don't stay too long.

316
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:54,410
Fine.

317
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:54,910
Good boy.

318
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:55,950
Go home.

319
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,910
I left some food for you at home.

320
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,660
Remember to finish it.

321
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:02,040
I'm going home.

322
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,040
Okay.

323
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,040
Be quick.

324
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:05,410
Bye.

325
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,040
All right.

326
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:08,790
Stay safe on the road.

327
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,080
How did you
get yourself beaten up again?

328
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:33,950
What was that for?

329
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:35,160
So, you do feel pain.

330
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,450
When are you going to leave Le's gang?

331
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:44,790
You're the big brother.

332
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,790
You should be a role model.

333
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:53,410
I even get scared
every time I get a call.

334
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:55,450
Think about Yuan and Lili.

335
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,790
Did you bring any money?

336
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,040
Fine.

337
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,540
I'll pay the bills.

338
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:12,910
Thanks. I'll pay you back.

339
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:15,080
Never mind. Just get well soon.

340
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:22,950
I stepped into this pit.

341
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:25,830
I must figure a way out.

342
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,450
I can lose my way,

343
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:30,580
but I can never lose

344
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:33,700
the family waiting for me at home.

345
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:53,080
Lili, dinner is ready.

346
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,660
Hello, sir.

347
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,790
Yes. I am Wei Zhiyuan's older brother.

348
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:11,910
May I know

349
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:13,160
if Yuan had

350
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,410
any extracurricular activities today?

351
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,200
He took a leave?

352
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,540
I didn't apply for a leave for him.

353
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:26,080
Okay.

354
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:26,910
Thanks.

355
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:27,950
Thank you for your time.

356
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:39,040
Lili, eat your dinner.

357
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,040
I need to go out.

358
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:42,790
Make it quick! I am hungry!

359
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:45,950
The duck meat is great.

360
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:47,450
Finish it while it's warm.

361
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,830
Do you know the new venue

362
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:50,450
for today?

363
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:52,450
No idea. I've never been there.

364
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:54,040
Le.

365
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:54,700
What is it?

366
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:04,700
What a surprise, Qian.

367
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:06,290
Where is Yuan?

368
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:08,910
No idea.

369
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:10,080
You can kill me here.

370
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,040
But you'll never find your brother.

371
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:14,410
Where is Yuan? Answer me!

372
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:15,450
What?

373
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:16,910
Who do you think you are?

374
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:19,660
Hold him!

375
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:20,660
What do you want?

376
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:24,540
Let him go!

377
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:26,700
I was...

378
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:27,410
Hold him!

379
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:33,410
Kneel!

380
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:34,040
Hold him!

381
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:34,910
Kneel!

382
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:36,540
Get down!

383
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:37,330
Where is my brother?

384
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:47,160
Le.

385
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:49,950
He can't just walk away as he wants.

386
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,910
It's not right.

387
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:54,910
We play it by the rules.

388
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:57,540
He has to leave something behind.

389
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:58,540
Right?

390
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:00,950
Right?

391
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:06,450
Leave a finger here

392
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,160
or leave your brother?

393
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:14,700
You nabbed his brother?

394
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,540
Bring me the kid.

395
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,790
Be quick!

396
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:33,540
Yuan.

397
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:34,700
Stay still.

398
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,290
Qian!

399
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:37,580
Kneel.

400
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:38,410
Qian!

401
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:41,290
Let him go!

402
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:43,910
We're going home.

403
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:44,790
Hold on.

404
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,700
Don't be scared. I'm here.

405
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,830
Don't be scared. I'm here.

406
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:58,700
Wei Qian.

407
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:00,450
Hu is right.

408
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:02,910
We must play it by the rules.

409
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:06,410
We sell wood during the day

410
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:08,040
and work with our fists at night.

411
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:11,700
Join a boxing match for me.

412
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,700
Then, you can leave.

413
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,410
No! You know how dangerous...

414
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:16,410
Brat!

415
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:21,290
You only got your name

416
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:22,660
because I gave it to you.

417
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,950
You managed to stay alive

418
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:27,160
because I allowed it!

419
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:30,910
You owe me a favor.

420
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,330
It's time to pay up.

421
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,410
Three matches.

422
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:45,160
If you win three matches,

423
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:47,450
I'll let you go.

424
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:51,410
You even get to keep your cut.

425
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:52,330
Okay?

426
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:56,540
Whatever, so long as I get to leave.

427
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,540
Scram. Let the boys go.

428
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:03,540
Let's go.

429
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:06,910
Don't look!

430
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:15,160
You nabbed his brother?

431
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,540
Who taught you that?

432
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,160
Sorry, Le.

433
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:25,660
I thought

434
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,290
we should follow the rules.

435
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,450
You think you're the smart one?

436
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,370
Qian!

437
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:17,870
One.

438
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:19,120
Two.

439
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,500
Three.

440
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,540
Four.

441
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:22,620
Five.

442
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:24,120
Six.

443
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:25,250
Le.

444
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:28,580
The betting odds are 1/50.

445
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,330
If Wei Qian doesn't lose,

446
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:33,620
we're making a killing.

447
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,330
Can you stop the fight?

448
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:13,250
Qian is all beat up.

449
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:21,500
Kid.

450
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Open your eyes and watch closely.

451
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,370
For your sake,

452
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:30,750
he can't lose.

453
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:32,120
He will not lose.

454
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:35,120
He has to win.

455
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:02,500
Qian! Stop fighting!

456
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,040
Let's go home!

457
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,160
Ten.

458
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,910
Nine.

459
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:26,540
Eight.

460
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:28,540
Seven.

461
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:30,660
Six.

462
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:32,910
Five.

463
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:34,660
Four.

464
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:36,290
Three.

465
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:38,160
Two.

466
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,660
One.

467
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:41,040
The winner

468
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,540
is Wei Qian!

469
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:04,120
Qian!

470
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:27,450
Don't cry.

471
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:29,330
I won.

472
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:30,950
You should smile.

473
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,080
Sorry.

474
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,450
You wouldn't have been in this fight

475
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:39,580
if it hadn't been for me.

476
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,000
Well, I did it for my brother.

477
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:48,950
You could've saved yourself

478
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:50,700
if you left me behind.

479
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:06,700
If I lost you,

480
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,870
I'd have nothing left.

481
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:17,700
Don't cry.

482
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,970
Parts of what was once lost

483
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:24,390
was found again.

484
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:27,220
Stay alive.

485
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,800
Live on

486
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:30,930
[158 CM, Yuan, Lili, 2013]
so you can find your home,

487
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,250
so you can go home.

488
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,200
Even if you have nothing,

489
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,200
you'll still have me.

490
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:44,830
Wei Qian,

491
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:46,080
you're taking so many courses
in advance.

492
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,580
Are you going for an early graduation?

493
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:48,580
Yeah.

494
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:50,330
You turned down
the student exchange offer.

495
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:51,080
Talk to the teacher.

496
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:51,750
Give me the spot.

497
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:52,830
You must know

498
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:54,080
some lenient professors.

499
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,580
- Introduce them to me.
- Help me out.

500
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:57,250
Don't be so stingy.

501
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:58,500
Sir, as usual.

502
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,370
Hey.

503
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:01,450
You want some noodles?

504
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:02,700
Never mind.

505
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:03,750
Wei Qian, bye!

506
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:12,870
Qian.

507
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:14,950
Please finish your study soon

508
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:16,580
and get back to the team.

509
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:18,330
We can't always have meetings here.

510
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:19,830
It's embarrassing for me.

511
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:21,750
Xiong.

512
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:23,370
You only invested in him

513
00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:25,330
when he could get into college.

514
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:26,830
He made it.

515
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:28,200
He finished a four-year course

516
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,700
in three years.

517
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,250
He should have made you proud.

518
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:34,250
Maybe he has, but not you.

519
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,330
What's wrong with me?

520
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,370
Come on.

521
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:42,370
Look. He is good at gaming.

522
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:43,950
He knows what players want.

523
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:45,700
The game he designed
has been so popular.

524
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:46,500
I have to

525
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:47,870
hire him as soon as possible.

526
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:49,830
We might even get our company listed.

527
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:51,700
We are a start-up company.

528
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,830
We need the fame
for our business to take off.

529
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:55,080
Fine. I won't be part of it.

530
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:55,700
Hello?

531
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,580
- Yeah. He's the man you need.
- Yes.

532
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:58,950
It's not what I mean.

533
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:00,450
Yes. I'll be right there.

534
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:01,700
Sorry.

535
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:04,080
Wei Qian!

536
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:07,950
Excuse me.

537
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:09,580
Am I still his boss?

538
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:10,450
He took off in the middle

539
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:11,370
of a meeting with me.

540
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:14,450
It can't be helped.

541
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:15,580
Nothing in this world

542
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:17,370
is more important
than his brother and sister.

543
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:20,500
After his parents passed away,

544
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,120
Wei Qian had everything
on his shoulders.

545
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:25,200
He works during the day
and studies at night.

546
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,830
He even worked as a bouncer.

547
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:30,330
But he left for Lili and Yuan.

548
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:31,580
The mobster skipped town.

549
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:34,700
To provide for his family,
he's been working at the pool hall

550
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:37,330
and doing game livestreaming
after he finished high school.

551
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,250
It was a good thing he met you.

552
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:40,830
You made him finish college

553
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:42,750
and invested in him to start a company.

554
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:44,620
Otherwise,
his talent would've been wasted.

555
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:53,550
