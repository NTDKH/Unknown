So sad that I decided to become a monk.

211
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:05,960
I went to the temple, shaved my head,

212

every day.

So, in less than a month,
he asked me to leave.

00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:22,040
Then, drink this for me.

338
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,040
You're great at singing.

339
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,920
How are you so good?

340
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,460
It's so annoying.

341
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:28,460
Come on. Drink up!

342
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:29,460
Our star.

343
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:31,170
I'm San Pang.

344
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:32,710
Mr. Wei.

345
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:34,290
Don't be like that. Come on.

346
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:35,040
Come on.

347
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:36,210
Mr. Wei...

348
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:37,040
Careful.

349
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,540
That wasn't enough.

350
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:39,460
That's enough.

351
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:41,290
To the next bar.

352
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:42,920
Let's continue.

353
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,790
Come on, let's continue drinking.

354
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:45,670
It was two against three.

355
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:46,960
No, he looks so tired

356
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,080
and reluctant...

357
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,210
It's on us.

358
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:50,210
Call a taxi.

359
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:50,710
The taxi is here.

360
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:51,790
Mr. Wei, your ride is here.

361
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:53,790
We've already booked the next bar.

362
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:54,960
The ride's here.

363
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:06,670
Good evening, sirs.

364
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:07,960
I'm Mr. Wei's brother.

365
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,290
My name is Wei Zhiyuan.

366
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,670
My brother can't hold his liquor well.

367
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:13,040
I'll be taking him home.

368
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:14,420
Xiong.

369
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:15,790
San Pang.

370
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:16,540
It's been a while.

371
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,040
Yuan.

372
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,670
Take good care of our clients.

373
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:21,580
Excuse us.

374
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,040
Yuan...

375
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,210
Qian,

376
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:28,670
we're going home.

377
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:30,670
Mr. Wei.

378
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:32,670
Where's the boy going?

379
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:33,670
Boy.

380
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:36,170
This is my little brother.

381
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:37,290
OK. We'll be in touch.

382
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:37,920
This is my little brother.

383
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,790
Keep in touch.

384
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:39,670
Mr. Wei.

385
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:41,170
All right. To the next stop.

386
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:42,290
Count Mr. Wei out.

387
00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:42,920
Mr. Wei's out.

388
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,040
All right.

389
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:10,540
Why did you suddenly

390
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:12,830
come back?

391
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:16,170
Didn't you tell me to come back
if I missed home?

392
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,920
Why didn't you tell me?

393
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:23,330
Why?

394
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:25,710
It's not like I'm never coming back.

395
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,040
Get some sleep.

396
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:31,920
We'll be home soon.

397

398
00:27:57,330 --> 00:27:59,080

399

Coming...

Zhiyuan, you don't even know.

401
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:10,830
He ends up like this every time
he comes back from a gathering.

402
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:12,040
He's hugged that toilet more times

403
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,790
than he's hugged me.

404
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:16,670
Are you done?

405
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:18,920
That's just the way business is.

406
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:21,330
Drink it.

407
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:23,170
What do you mean by
"that's just the way business is"?

408
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:25,210
Next time, tell them
your little brother is back

409
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:26,170
and he doesn't like it when you drink.

410
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:27,420
If you get drunk, you get punished.

you're different now.

Someone's going to get it now.

414
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,580
You're one to talk.

415
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:39,920
Weren't you caught on camera

416
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,460
with

417
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:42,420
some guy?

418
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,290
What guy?

419
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:44,540
Guy...

420
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:46,420
A guy should behave like a proper man.

421
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:48,330
Don't talk nonsense.

422
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:50,790
Who's talking nonsense?

423
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:52,290
They caught you guys on camera.

424
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:53,670
I told you it was a misunderstanding.

425
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:55,460
I was just having dinner
with a group of friends.

426
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:56,540
Paparazzi were snapping photos.

427
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:57,710
You're making a fuss over nothing.

428
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,790
Why would they report it
if it wasn't true?

429
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:01,580
How am I supposed to find a boyfriend

430
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:02,790
if you keep saying things like that?

431

432

Wei Zhiyuan!

434
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:09,790
Don't think you're all that just because

435
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:10,920
you came back from studying abroad.

436
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,330
I've been overseas too.

437
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:14,420
Our levels are about the same.

438
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:17,080
I can't be bothered to compare with you.

439
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,540
I can't be bothered to talk to you.

440
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:19,540
Waste of my time.

441
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:21,040

You're being ridiculous.

Why did you say that in front of Qian?

446
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:29,420
What did I say in front of Qian?

447
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:31,080
I can't even tell the truth now?

448
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:33,210
What truth? I'm telling you it was fake.

449
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:34,080
What's fake?

450
