Qian,

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,500
there's no need to be so nervous.

6

Relax.

7
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:29,750
Sorry for this sudden home visit.

8
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:31,500
I understand

9
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,620
that you couldn't make it

10
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,000
to the parent-teacher meeting.

11
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:35,660
I just hope you can find some time

12
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,160
no matter how busy you are

13
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,160
to check in

14
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,910
on how Yuan's doing in school.

15
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,750
If he does something wrong,

16
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:42,620
you can

17
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:44,750
discipline and punish him, sir.

18
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:48,750
The little brothers
usually get into trouble.

19
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,500
I can relate to that.

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,410
In fact,

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,750
Yuan hasn't done anything wrong.

22
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:58,750
He just has some problems

23
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:02,500
with things other than school.

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,750
Other than school?

25
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:05,750
Yes.

26
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,500
Sir, I don't understand

27
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:09,620
what you meant.

28
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:13,120
All right.

29
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,000
Let me put it this way.

30
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,620
Yuan is younger

31
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,120
than the other students.

32
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:22,870
It's only natural
that he's a bit distant

33
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,870
from them.

34
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:30,500
Smart kids like him usually focus
on their studies

35
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,370
but struggle with socializing.

36
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:34,620
You understand

37
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:37,250
that interpersonal relationships

38
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:39,870
are a crucial part of growing up.

39
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:41,370
Does he not get along
with his classmates?

40
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:46,000
It's not that bad, really.

41
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,620
It's just that in the whole class,

42
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:49,410
he only talks to the class monitor.

43
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,120
Even during breaks,
he stays in the classroom.

44
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:56,040
This is what's worrying the teachers.

45
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,250
In any case,

46
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,250
please pay more attention to him.

47
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:04,120
That's the main reason for my visit.

48
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,120
All right.

there are some clubs in our school

that you might let Yuan join.

59
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,120
It could help Yuan
build relations with his peers.

then I'll do it.

174
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:10,890
I'll get them.

175
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:13,510
I'll go.
I'm going to get fried chicken anyway.

176
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,340
Do you want anything?

177
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:16,840
No, I'm fine.

178
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:24,970
Wei Zhiyuan.

179
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:26,470
What?

180
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:27,840
No locked doors in this house. Open up.

181
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,260
I accidentally locked it.

182
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:32,090
What are you doing?

183
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:33,760
Taking notes. Exams are coming up.

184
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:36,470
Why did you sign up
for a long-distance race?

185
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:38,510
Didn't you tell me
to take up outdoor sports?

186
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:41,220
There are people
running on the track with me

187
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,340
and people watching me run.

188
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:43,840
There are a lot
of socializing opportunities.

189
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,720
You…

190
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,340
Can your legs handle it?

191
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:50,340
Yes, they're fine.

192
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:52,590
I'm going to bed soon.

193
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:53,470
You should get some rest too.

194
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:54,090
Good night.

195
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:54,840
You…

196
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:23,590
Wei Zhiyuan.

197
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:06,090
Wei Zhiyuan.

198
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,220
Wei Zhiyuan.

199
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,970
OK, stop.

200
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:27,970
Stop running.

201
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:30,590
I said stop, did you hear me?

202
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,220
Wei Zhiyuan.

203
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:40,390
I told you to take a break.
Did you hear me?

204
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:54,760
Qian.

205
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:58,470
Qian.

206
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:00,470
I finally did it.

207
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:08,220
Yuan!

208
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,720
Dr. Lin said…

209
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:32,470
Keep your voice down.

210
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:35,140
Dr. Lin said Yuan needs
to be here for observation,

211
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,470
in case he has…

212
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:40,260
Rhabdomyolysis.

213
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:46,760
He's a stubborn mule.

214
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,340
It's impossible to rein him in.

215
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,590
He got that from you…

216
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,340
Well, he did…

217
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,720
Come here.

218
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,720
What?

219
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,720
Just talk here.

220
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:04,970
I mean,

221
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:06,640
he revolves around you all the time,

222
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:09,590
and that's how he ended up
as stubborn as you.

223
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,090
Life used to be simple.

224
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:15,470
Stay alive.

225
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:17,090
Have food

226
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:18,720
and a bed to sleep on.

227
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,340
But look at him now.

228
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,340
I really don't know

229
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:29,590
what kids these days want.

230
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,390
I think you guys are just too withdrawn.

231
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:37,260
Maybe you should get a girlfriend.

232
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:39,640
As if girlfriends come so easily.

233
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,470
I've always thought
that having another woman in your house

234
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:45,340
would change everything.

235
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:48,970
It's awkward.

236
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,640
Um…

237
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,470
Hello, Ms. Liu.

238
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:56,220
Sit, please.

239
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,220
Sorry to keep you waiting.

240
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,590
This is Wei Qian.

241
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:00,970
Hello, Mr. Wei.

242
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,970
Sit down.

243
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:05,090
You guys enjoy your chat.

244
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:06,220
Bye.

245
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,340
I'm off.

246
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,720
The food here is always good.

247
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,840
I come here often.

248
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,220
Do you cook?

249
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,220
Not often.

250
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:21,590
What's your blood type?

251
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,510
I've used all my contacts

252
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,720
for your brother's happiness.

253
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,590
It just feels awkward.

254
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:33,220
Do you work out?

255
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:34,970
Do you eat fried food at night?

256
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:37,220
Have you ever measured
your normal heart rate?

257
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:38,840
No.

258
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,220
What are you scribbling there?

259
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,590
I'm taking notes.

260
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,470
She's proactive.

261
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:47,090
Do you work out?

262
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:50,220
You know what,

263
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,470
I stepped in dog poo on my heels

264
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:52,720
when I was out today.

265
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:55,590
I wasn't planning to come over,

266
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:56,840
but I heard a handsome was gonna be here,

267
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,970
so I came to check him out.

268
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:59,840
You seem to be my type.

269
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:01,840
Have you ever had a girlfriend?

270
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,220
Won't you give me a chance?

271
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,340
There's a girl in our company

272
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:07,090
who's always on her phone
during meetings.

273
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:08,590
She even makes typos.
Can you believe it?

274
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:09,470
The spellings for "while"

275
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:10,970
and "where" are completely different.

276
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:12,590
They're not the same at all.

277
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:15,090
This girl talks way too much.

278
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:16,720
You're one to talk.

279
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,840
You're the loudest.

280
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,840
It's enough that we have you.

281
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,590
What did you say, Wei Zhiyuan?

282
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:21,720
Sorry, San Pang.

283
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,340
You tried to step on me?

284
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:25,090
I'm talking about you.

285
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:26,470
You can hear the voices inside?

286
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:28,090
I can see her keep talking and talking.

287
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:29,840
She's a motormouth.

288
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,840
This one won't do.

289
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,720
Did she even graduate?

290
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,090
I'm so dumbfounded. Absurd.

291
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:35,340
Ha-ha.

292
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:38,220
Why aren't you saying anything?

293
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:38,970
Probably never met

294
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:40,340
a girl as beautiful as me, huh?

295
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,590
Very few girls

296
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,720
can pull off red checkers.

297
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,090
Red checkers.

298
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:47,720
Do you know how hard it is?

299
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,840
Are you looking down on me?

300
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:52,090
Look at me.

301
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,470
I've never scored 100 on a test.

302
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:55,840
How dare you get 100?

303
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:02,260
It's because Mommy loves you.

304
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,340
Qian…

305
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:17,220
Go away!

306
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:17,970
Qian!

307
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:19,970
I'm fine.

308
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:20,840
What's the matter?

309
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:23,090
Are you OK?

310
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:40,890
Qian,

311
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:44,470
why won't you save me?

312
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,760
Wei Qian…

313
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:50,390
Why won't you save me?

314
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,970
Qian…

315
00:15:58,970 --> 00:15:59,970
Qian…

316
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:05,220
Qian, I'm not feeling well.

317
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:07,340
Help me.

318
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:21,840
A perfect score?

319
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,220
You want to be a model student?

320
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:25,720
You're so amazing, huh?

321
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,220
Full marks…

322
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:27,970
Come here.

323
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:28,590
Getting 100…

324
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:30,720
You're so great for getting 100.

325
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,840
The sight of you…

326
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,840
The sight of you makes me sick!

327
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:35,220
Why won't you die?

328
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:36,470
Die!

329
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:37,220
I hate you!

330
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,470
Trying to fight back?

331
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:40,970
I hate you!

332
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:11,220
Qian!

333
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,010
I'm fine.

334
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:16,340
I'm fine…

335
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,090
I'm fine…

336
00:17:19,090 --> 00:17:20,090
I slipped

337
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:21,090
and the things dropped.

338
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:22,720
Come on.

339
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,720
Are you OK?

340
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:28,840
You all right?

341
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:30,510
I'm fine.

342
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,720
This happens every time.

343
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:37,720
It's one thing for that nosy San Pang
to set me up with blind dates.

344
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,590
But why were you and Lili there?

345
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:42,590
We came to check out
our future sister-in-law.

346
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:44,390
Sister-in-law, my foot.

347
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:46,470
Having you guys
is more than enough for me.

348
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:49,470
It'll be easier
if you have a partner, right?

349
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:52,840
I can take care of you all by myself.

350
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:53,720
Is that so?

351
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,590
What are you trying to say?

352
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,720
Do you remember the first time
you helped me blow-dry my hair?

353
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,470
Almost set it on fire.

354
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:03,840
You talk too much.

355
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,470
All right.
I'll let the rest dry by itself.

356
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:07,340
Dry by itself?

357
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:09,340
Every time you leave it half-wet.
What's the point?

358
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:11,090
You haven't showered yet.
Go take a shower

359
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:11,840
and go to bed.

360
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:14,840
Sheesh. You're like this every time.

361
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,470
Good boy.

362
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:19,090
Put that down.

363
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:20,140
I'll sort that out.

364
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,090
You always leave your hair half-wet.

365
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:29,220
Qian.

366
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:30,220
What?

367
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,470
You're not alone.

368
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:35,220
Good night.

369
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,590
Good night.

370
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:40,590
Brat.

371
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:43,930
People come and go in our lives.

372
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:47,140
[174 CM, Yuan, 2016]
It's fortunate to have someone

373
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,640
stay by your side, isn't it?

374
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,470
Qian.

375
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:07,340
What?

376
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:09,340
What time is it?
Why aren't you ready yet?

377
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:10,970
We're going to be late.

378
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:12,220
If we are, then skip it.

379
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,010
What are you talking about?

380
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:14,590
It's an important day.

381
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:15,510
You graduated early,

382
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:17,140
and Zhiyuan is in university.

383
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:18,840
At least let me have
a glimpse of university life.

384
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:20,340
You know how to tie a tie?

385
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,220
No. Hurry up and do it.

386
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:25,720
Zhiyuan and I are leaving first.

387
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:36,220
Hey, I'm from the photography club.

388
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,840
We're planning to shoot
a series of portrait photos.

389
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,590
Are you interested?

390
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:41,720
But I'm not a model.

391
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,220
That's OK, you don't have to be a model.

392
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,220
I'll teach you how to pose.

393
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,090
I can show you

394
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:45,970
the movements and poses.

395
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:46,470
Really?

396
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:46,970
Yes.

397
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:48,720
You're pretty.

398
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,590
Are you mixed-race?

399
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:50,840
No.

400
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:51,220
Thanks.

401
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:51,970
It's OK.

402
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:53,470
Mind if we

403
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:54,470
exchange numbers?

404
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:58,590
Hey there, do you need something?

405
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:00,090
You're from the photography club?

406
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:01,220
Perfect. What a coincidence.

407
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:02,220
Let me ask you something.

408
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,090
I just bought this camera yesterday.

409
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:03,840
It's hard to use…

410
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,090
Who are you?

411
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,970
Me?

412
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:08,510
I'm her brother.

413
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,590
And this guy too.

414
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:11,840
We're siblings.

415
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,760
You…

416
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:16,720
Why don't we exchange numbers?

417
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,840
That's OK.

418
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:20,340
I'm not that good with cameras.

419
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,340
I have something to get to.
I have to go.

420
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:22,340
Is that so?

421
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:23,470
Qian.

422
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:24,590
I didn't know university students
were so friendly.

423
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:25,470
He just asked me if I was mixed-race

424
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:27,220
and if I was interested in modeling.

425
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,890
Where's your other brother?

426
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:31,340
No idea.

427
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:33,220
I was looking for him too.

428
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,220
Strange.

429
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,840
Over there!

430
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,720
Where?

431
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,840
There.

432
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,590
Zhiyuan! Where were you?

433
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:43,590
Yuan looks handsome

434
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:45,720
in these photos.

435
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,470
Already attracting at such a young age.

436
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:50,340
I wonder how he'll turn out
when he grows up.

438

Happy graduation.

439
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,890
Not bad.

440
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:01,220
Guess I don't have to worry too much

441
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,720
about you making friends.

442
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:04,470
All right.

443
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:05,720
OK. Sorted out the settings.

444
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,970

445
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:07,470
Get in place. Come on.

446
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:08,590
Didn't you say you already took a photo?

447
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:09,470
That's right.

448
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:10,340
Just take the photo.

449
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:12,340
Come on, stand properly.

450
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:13,720
Qian, let's take a photo.

451
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,840
There's a stain here.

452
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,470
All set. Come on.

453
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:19,470
OK. Looking good.

454
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:20,510
Come on.

455
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:22,720
Stand closer to each other.

456
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,340
