00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:07,920
Xiong,

2
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:09,700
I'll be straight with you.

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:11,960
Honestly, I don't understand

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,330
why you keep opposing it.

5
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:15,790
I think this APP

6
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:17,420
will go viral in the future.

7
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,420
We should seize the opportunity

8
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:20,580
as it's still not a rat race.

9
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:22,670
I think I've made it

10
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:24,040
very clear.

11
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:26,580
Is that so hard to understand?

12
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,540
All you do is talk,

13
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:31,330
of course, everything is simple.

14
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:33,040
But have you considered

15
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,790
the budget and the risk?

16
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:35,790
Less competition means less data

17
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:37,920
for us to work with.

18
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:39,420
And it's not what H.O.T

19
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,420
is active in.

20
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:42,790
What makes you think we can do it?

21
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:44,420
Active in...

22
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:46,420
When we first met,

23
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:47,580
I was just an agent for debugging.

24
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:49,170
Then, you started

25
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:50,290
splurging money on throwaway games.

26
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,210
You didn't even change the characters
or the dialogues.

27
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:53,670
You repackaged them
and released them just like that.

28
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:56,210
Xiong,

29
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:58,210
short-term gains
won't cut it.

30
00:00:59,040 --> 00:00:59,960
We have to think long term

31
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,670
to not be left behind, right?

32
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:03,170
Please,

33
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:06,290
we don't even have
development engineers on board.

34
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:07,210
Over here.

35
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:08,540
Yes, could you help me key this in?

36
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,420
Sorry, it's quite a lot.

37
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:11,920
Thanks.

38
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:14,330
Qian, I'm begging you.

39
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:16,080
Can you please not be so self-righteous?

40
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:17,290
Self-righteous?

41
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:17,790
Yes.

42
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:20,170
Are you guys done?

43
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:23,950
Take a look
at what's hanging behind you.

44
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,580
It's H.O.T.

45
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:28,540
You're all forgetting

46
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:30,420
that the three of us
started this company together.

47
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:31,830
Let's talk it out.

48
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:34,330
Stop being sarcastic
and attacking each other.

49
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:35,420
If we just do what we've always done

50
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:36,790
and keep playing it safe,

51
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:39,790
then why are we even doing all of this?

52
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:44,540
Just pack up and shut it down.

53
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:46,830
That'll save us rent.

54
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:48,830
Gee, thanks for thinking of that.

55
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:52,040
I'm the one who has to raise funds.

56
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,920
I'm the one who has to answer
to the investors.

57
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,920
I don't want us to lose money.

58
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,040
Is that wrong?

59
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:58,790
Are you really that unhappy?

60
00:01:58,790 --> 00:01:59,920
If you are, then let's just split up.

61
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,040
Fine. Let's do it.

62
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,540
Let's split up. Bring out the contract.

63
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:03,460
It's right here.

64
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,290
When did you two

65
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:08,920
get together?

66
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,040
Split up? Just like that?

67
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:14,660
What about

68
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:16,040
the game exhibition next month?

69
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,960
Okay, then we'll stop
working altogether.

70
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:19,420
That's right.

71
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,960
Everyone already has
so much on their hands.

72
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,790
We don't have any extra hands

73
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:24,330
to help you build this APP.

74
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,670
My team can help.

75
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:27,830
What team?

76
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:29,540
This isn't for students.

77
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,420
I set up a team with my seniors.

78
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,920
Students should do what students do.

79
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,710
Don't meddle in adults' affairs.

80
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:40,290
Qian,

81
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,540
were you just doing what students do?

82
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,040
My brother hasn't been home for days

83
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,330
because of this.

84
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,540
So I'd like to be of some help.

85
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:55,420
In my opinion,

86
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,580
this project is really in line

87
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:58,710
with the trend of the times.

88
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:01,920
But if you outsource it,

89
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,420
it'll cost you a lot of money.

90
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:05,460
And the core of the production

91
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:06,790
won't be in your hands.

92
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,290
Why don't we do it ourselves?

93
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:10,040
My seniors and I

94
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,460
can take this project.

95
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,670
That'll save you a large amount of money

96
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:15,170
on upfront development.

97
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,710
Once we get everything going,

98
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:19,170
we can bring in professionals

99
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:20,210
to endorse it.

100
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,080
Then you only need to bear the cost

101
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,460
of the backend operation.

102
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,080
And once the APP is launched,

103
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,710
the advertising revenue will cover

104
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,960
all the money you've invested.

105
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:37,040
Yuan, you've come

106
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,040
just in time.

107
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,920
How does the saying go again?

108
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,790
"The student surpasses the master."

109
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:46,670
Xiong, sorry,

110
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:48,670
but I think your decision was too hasty.

111
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:52,040
I'm only doing this

112
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,290
because I believe in my brother.

113
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:03,670
Fine.

114
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:06,210
Maybe I haven't
thought it through clearly.

115
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:07,960
I didn't think clearly.

116
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,790

00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,340
Wei Lili,

174
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:09,540
this is the third one this week.

175
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:11,790
That's why I can't let Qian know.

176
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,790
How are you going to be a model
like this?

177
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:23,290
I won't be late once I'm a model.

178
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:25,790
Thanks, Zhiyuan.

179
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:31,790
You could've at least closed the door.

180
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:37,920
I'm going out.

181
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:46,710
Wei Lili.

182
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,290
Qian.

183
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:50,120
Did I wake you?

184
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:51,540
What are you doing?

185
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:53,540
Guess what?

186
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:56,170
Someone asked me to be their model.

187
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:58,040
Don't I look pretty?

188
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,170
Go and get changed.

189
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:01,920
Why?

190
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,920
Don't I look good in this?

191
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,170
It's all the rage this year.

192
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:05,170
I said,

193
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,420
go upstairs and get changed.

194
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:10,790
I think it looks okay. It looks good.

195
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:13,040
Don't make me say it a third time.

196
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,710
Don't worry so much.

197
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,040
Maybe you should take a look

198
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,210
at what the heck you're wearing.

199
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:18,910
How old do you think you are?

200
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:19,830
Why are you wearing
such revealing clothes?

201
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,580
Well, you can pick me up later.

202
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,040
I'm all grown up now.

203
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,290
Do you need money that badly?

204
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:28,210
No.

205
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:30,920
It's just the chance comes
once in a blue moon.

206
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:34,330
Are you trying to dress like that woman?

207
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,540
Who?

208
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,040
Say it.

209
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:42,040
Are you trying to be like your mother?

210
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:45,000
You've gone too far.

211
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,920
How can you say that?

212
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:49,290
How can you compare me

213
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:50,540
to that woman?

214
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:54,040
You're such a fossil.

215
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,330
If you're going out dressed like that,
don't bother coming back.

216
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:05,460
I know

217
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:07,580
Qian has been protecting me
in his own way,

218
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,920
but how could he compare me to her?

219
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,790
When we were kids,
she rushed in with a knife,

220
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:15,330
saying she wanted to kill us
and then herself.

221
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:18,290
Qian just patted my head and told me

222
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:19,920
not to be afraid
and that he was there for me.

223
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,540
I remember hearing his heartbeat.

224
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,670
And it felt like
I had nothing to be afraid of.

225
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:27,670
But how could he

226
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,170
compare me to her now?

227
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:47,170
Miss,

228
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,420
are you all right?

229
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:52,540
Do you need help?

230
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:55,330
Were you in an accident?

231
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,920
I'll take you to the hospital.

232
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,830
No...

233
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,210
It looks bad.

234
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:07,460
Wipe it.

235
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:13,540
Come on.

236
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:14,960
I'll take you to the hospital.

237
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,960
It's been bleeding.

238
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:20,420
Qian,

239
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:21,920
I'm back.

240
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:30,790
Qian?

241
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,210
Qian, what's wrong?

242
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,950
Qian.

243
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,080
You have a fever.

244
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:55,080
Should we go to the doctor?

245
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,210
No, I'll just sleep it off.

246
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,580
Qian.

247
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,830
I love you.

248
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:11,710
I love you so much.

249
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:14,540
What's that?

250
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:16,210
That.

251
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:20,040
That's nothing.

252
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:34,130
Sit up.

253
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:35,920
Come.

254
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,210
Better?

255
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,460
Here, have some porridge.

256
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,660
Is it too hot?

257
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,540
Yuan, what time is it?

258
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,460
It's 11 PM.

259
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:26,670
Where's Lili?

260
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,040
She hasn't come back yet.

261
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:30,540
Qian, are you sure
you don't need to go to the doctor?

262
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:31,330
I'm going to find her.

263
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:33,670
What's wrong?

264
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,830
She ran out this afternoon
after I scolded her.

265
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:42,290
It's too late.

266
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:43,290
I have to find her.

267
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:44,420
Qian.

268
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:46,420
You have to rest.

269
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,290
You rest.

270
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:57,040
I'll find Lili
and get you some medicine.

271
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:18,920
Hello?

272
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,420
Yes.

273
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:21,920
I'm her brother.

274
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,170
Is Lili there?

275
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:28,920
Okay, thank you.

276
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,290
Got it.

277
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:40,290
You sure you don't need me with you?

278
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:41,330
I'm sure. Thank you.

279
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:42,330
Are you sure?

280
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:43,830
Thank you. Please go back.

281
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:45,540
Call me if anything comes up.

282
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:46,790
Okay, thanks.

283
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:48,790
- Bye.
- Bye.

284
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:51,170
I'm leaving.

285
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:52,040
Okay.

286
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,710
What are you doing?

287
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:03,210
That hurts!

288
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:04,790
Why didn't you answer your phone?

289
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:06,330
Do you know that guy?

290
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:07,920
Why did you get into his car?

291
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,290
Let go! That hurts!

292
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:11,790
What's gotten into you and Qian today?

293
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:13,540
He offered me a ride back
out of kindness.

294
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,710
We're just worried about you.

295
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:19,540
Don't you know it's dangerous?

296
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:21,790
You shouldn't just get into a car
with someone you don't know.

297
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:23,210
Qian is worried about you too.

298
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:24,170
Worried?

299
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:25,540
He was the one who told me to leave.

300
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,080
And I did as he said.

301
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:28,920
Even strangers care about me.

302
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,790
And all you two do is yell at me.

303
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:40,600
Qian.

304
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:52,160
Glad you're back.

305
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:04,670
- Qian!
- Qian!

306
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:08,790
[Lin Hospital]

307
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:15,920
Doctor!

308
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,580
How's my brother?

309
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:21,580
Tell me what's wrong
with my brother first.

310
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:25,950
Is your brother still smoking?

311
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,040
Yes.

312
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,040
What's wrong with your brother?

313
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,300
Pneumonia.

314
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:35,960
He got a punctured lung back at Le's

315
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:37,580
and he still smokes.

316
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,210
Open your eyes and watch.

317
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,290
For your sake,

318
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:47,200
your brother can't fall,

319
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:49,390
and he won't let himself fall.

320
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:55,040
Where is Le now?

321
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,260
None of your business.

322
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:03,060
Don't forget why your brother
wanted to quit for good.

323
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,080
Yuan!

324
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:14,790
What?

325
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:19,920
Got a lighter?

326
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,040
No.

327
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:24,530
Give me 20.

328
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:29,410
I only have 100.

329
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:30,540
I'll keep the change.

330
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:33,400
Try to cut down.

331
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,990
Don't end up like my brother.

332
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,540
Qian, why are you out of bed?

333
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,710
I just used the bathroom.

334
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:03,170
Bathroom.

335
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:05,040
Don't move around unless you have to.

336
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:07,210
Please be an adult

337
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:08,670
and take care of yourself.

338
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,330
I'm fine.

339
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,170
Fine?

340
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:14,580
You have pneumonia.

341
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:18,830
Did the doctor say anything else?

342
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:20,790
He told you to quit smoking.

343
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,320
No more smoking for you, got it?

344
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,630
We'll go home as soon
as the drip is finished.

345
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:40,080
I'll do it myself.

346
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,710
Always trying to be strong.

347
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:53,630
You're a nag.

348
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,410
Milk.

349
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:25,920
Finish it.

350
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:36,040
This is too much.

351
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:45,040
Okay. Time for bed.

352
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:45,920
What?

353
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:47,960
Come on.

354
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:51,960
Stop telling me what to do.
I'm not sleepy yet.

355
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,700
Don't you have university assignments
to worry about?

356
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:56,920
I can do them remotely.

357
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,290
Don't worry.

358
00:19:58,290 --> 00:19:59,830
Then go out and have fun
with your friends.

359
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:01,210
You're always sticking to me.

360
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,540
Don't want to.

361
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:08,370
What are you doing?

362
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,030
Chatting with you.

363
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:12,710
Don't want you to be bored.

364

Qian.

365
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:22,040
You don't have
to shoulder everything alone.

366
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:25,170
I can take care of you and Lili.

367
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,540
Hands off.

368
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:34,670
What have you been doing at university?

369
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:37,460
Didn't you build a team or something?

370
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:40,920
With my seniors.

371
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,040
What for?

372
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:44,580
I want to work harder

373
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:45,670
to catch up to you.

374
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,290
Catch up to me?

375
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:50,420
Is that all the ambition you got?

376
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,790
I want you to surpass me at least.

377
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,790
It's hot, Yuan.

378
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:02,330
Get your hands off me.

379
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:05,830
It's hot. Go away.

380
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,790
But you used to hold me like this
when I was little.

381
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:12,170
I'm surprised you're bringing it up.

382
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:14,040
That's because you used to kick me
whenever you had nightmares.

383
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:17,040
But you never kicked me out.

384
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,960
Move over. It's hot.

385
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,790
Oh, right.

386
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:29,710
I saved up some money
for you to study abroad.

387
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,330
Think about it
and tell me where you want to go.

388
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:35,330
I think the US is a good choice.

389
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:37,920
Will you go then?

390
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,920
Why would I go?

391
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:40,960
I saved up for you to go.

392
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:44,290
Then I won't go.

393
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,790
You don't get to say no.

394
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:51,460
If I go to the US,

395
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:54,040
will you come and see me?

396
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:55,540
I'll think about it.

397
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,920
The flight tickets are expensive.

398
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:02,170
Thinking about it,
the UK could work too.

399
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,960
No.

400
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,710
They say there are too many
thieves in the UK.

401
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:10,210
It's too dangerous for you to go alone.

402
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:15,290
I want

403
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:20,420
to stay with you like this forever.
